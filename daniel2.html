    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:13-16</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows 
      to be slain.</strong> Because Daniel was the head over the magicians and over all of them, so they were going to kill Daniel and all of them too. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then Daniel answered with counsel 
      and wisdom</strong>  There is that God living in there, see, that Spirit of God.  He answered with counsel and wisdom. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth 
      to slay the wise men of Babylon:</strong>  He had an order to kill them all. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then 
      Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king</strong>  Pretty bold wasn’t he, to go right to the king?</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:18-28</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and
        his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel 
        answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</strong>  Their lives were spared.  You see, I am sure that some of you have found answers 
        in a dream.  He calls it a night vision.  I am sure that you had a night vision, and God directed him here.  Now these things come from God and I am sure many of us have had things 
        answered and direction given by dreams in the night.  And that is God in us. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom 
        unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</strong>  Now you can’t know understanding unless you have God in your heart.  That comes after you have accepted Jesus 
        Christ.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</strong>  Our God. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">I thank thee, and praise thee, 
        O thou God of my fathers,</strong>  Do you see why Daniel was favored? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast 
        now made known unto us the king's matter. Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy 
        not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</strong> </p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">And I don’t believe that Daniel was just crying out for himself.  I don’t think God could have used him.  I think he was crying out for all of his friends and for 
      those that were in error and didn’t know truth and didn’t know the true God.  I don’t think he just did it to save his life.  I believe Daniel was a greater man than that.  There was a 
      great love in him that caused him to do that. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that 
      will make known unto the king the interpretation.</strong> Do you know some of the prophecies and some of the word of God that says when we are brought before kings in the last days and 
      before governors and rulers, that we should not even think about what we are going to speak but the Spirit will speak through us?  See, it is the same thing all over again that is 
      coming.  This is why we have to know our God and know the Spirit if we are ever going to accomplish for Christ what he has told us that we can accomplish. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">The king answered and 
      said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</strong>  Can’t you imagine that old king was 
      really upset?  After ordering that all of these should be slain and here comes a man that says I can do it.  You know?  But listen to what Daniel tells him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Daniel answered in the 
      presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</strong>  </p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">He wasn’t afraid to tell that king there was a God in heaven.  He was afraid of nothing, what man could do to him.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 5</p>
    

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-cyan">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions 
      of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</strong>  And we know that he goes and explains the whole thing about the image of gold and of brass and of iron and of clay and the toes and the 
      kingdoms divided which is, I believe, where we are now.  I do.  I feel that this is where we are right now as far – I don’t want to get on to Bible prophecy, but I feel by the Spirit 
      that we are where the iron and the clay cannot mix.  There is a divided country over there, see.  And the world is divided in their opinion about many things.  And we are right in that 
      place where nothing is stable.  Iron and clay cannot mix.  And that is what the Bible says. </p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Let me just read this much.  I hadn’t planned on it, but I see it right here.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:41-49</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the 
      kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, 
      and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</strong>  And we know the condition over there right now, don’t we?  Remember this was that country, and he 
      just said over here it would be in the latter days.  So we can claim it for this now. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the 
      seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</strong> Did you ever see such a mixing of people?  We had Americans and Germans and Frenchmen 
      and everybody from all of the different countries in the world almost, over there trying to get this thing straightened out, but they could not mix.  It wouldn’t stand.  I don’t think 
      this has ever happened in history before, where people from all nations, all these reporters and preachers and you name it, they have been over there trying to straighten this 
      thing out. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,</strong> See, God is going to take over pretty soon.  I hope we are all ready, don’t you?  
      Amen.  We are part of that. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and 
      it shall stand for ever.</strong>   What a promise.  That is right now.  Absolutely.  I do believe it.  God is about ready to set his kingdom up.  That is why we are in school.  That 
      is why we're learning.  Amen. </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 6</p> 
    
    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now Daniel 4, because I don’t want to get too much on that, because I want to learn more about Daniel’s life and see what his secret was.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 4:1-3</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,</strong> Now look.  All 
      people, all nations and languages <strong class="w3-text-cyan">that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought 
      toward me.</strong>  The king is saying. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation 
      to generation.</strong>  Now this is after Nebuchadnezzar had just tried to burn these three kids up, these three young men up, and found out it didn’t work.  They came out not even 
      smelling of smoke.  So now he is recognizing God for who he is, for a while here.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 4:8-9</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the 
      name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods:</strong> Do you notice how he changes this? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and before him I told the dream, saying, O Belteshazzar, master of the 
      magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation 
      thereof.</strong>  You see, they are going to know you and they are going to recognize you when God starts pouring his Spirit, his true Spirit, out through us.  They are going to recognize 
      that you are just not an average person, that there has to be a supernatural God living inside of you that you are knowing these things by.  Because the Lord says that we will just 
      confound all of these people of the earth.  Even the kings of the earth won’t know which way to go.  They will come to us for counsel.  Now that is what the Word says.  Because they will 
      lack understanding.  They won’t know how to get out of the problems of the earth.  They will seek out, just like the king sought out Daniel.</p> 
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Now we are going to 24.  And this was the part where he had the heart of the beast and how he was eating like a beast of a field and so on and so forth.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 4:24-26</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> This is the interpretation,</strong>   This is the part where the tree grew up, this area 
      right here, and where he cut the tree down.  I don’t know if you are familiar with it or not, where they were going to keep the stump and put a ring of brass and iron around it and 
      keep the stump and that was concerning his kingdom. This is the interpretation, O king, This is the dream the king had had. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and this is the decree of the most High, which is 
      come upon my lord the king: That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field,</strong>  Now this was the interpretation of the dream that he 
      had about the tree and how his kingdom was going to be taken, because they were going to cut the tree off but they were going to save the stump.  And so he is telling him. 
      <strong class="w3-text-cyan">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew 
      of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee,</strong>  Or seven years. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he 
      will.</strong> Now I want to tell you something here.  If you are going through some things you don’t understand, maybe God is trying to teach you who God is.  Amen.  I mean me too, 
      you know.  Because he says it right here and he wasn’t afraid to tell him.  Daniel wasn’t afraid to tell him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, 
      and giveth it to whomsoever he</strong>  Pleases or he will.  It is none of our business what ones standing is or the other ones standing is.  It is God that sets in order as he wants to.  
      Amen.  That is God’s business.  It is none of my business.  My business is to accept what he puts on me, the call he gives me.  It is not my business to worry about where he places 
      somebody else.  My business is to fulfill what he calls me to do, otherwise I am the loser. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be 
      sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</strong> Boy, he was bold wasn’t he?  Amen.  He stood a chance of him getting killed right there, but you see, 
      he wasn’t afraid to speak.  Do you know why?  Because he knew God.  And he knew God had sent him.  And that no man could touch him, or no beast could kill him.  Only God. </p>

    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">I tell you if a people in this earth ever gets to the place where Daniel got, and that kind of faith in God, you are going to see some things 
     start to happen.  Amen.</p>

     <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 4:27,29</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee,</strong> He is saying, hear me, 
      man, what I am saying. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.</strong>  Of thy 
      calm and quiet, in other words. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</strong> What Daniel was trying to show him was that he had had such 
      pride – this king – and self will and jealousy.  And this was his sin, that he thought that kingdom was his, and that he didn’t recognize that God had set him on that throne.  And here 
      is a terrible danger if God calls us into a special calling, that we think that we are somebody and because we are somebody, God has chosen us for some calling or saved us for something.  
      That is a lot of baloney.  It is because he loves us and because he is merciful and because he has a plan for our lives if we will obey him.  But there is a danger of pride and self will 
      and jealousy. </p>
