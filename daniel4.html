      they were being accused falsely for causing uprising among the people.  And Paul <strong class="w3-text-cyan">says Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. But this I confess 
        unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy,</strong>  Or false. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the 
        prophets:</strong> Now, this is the same war going on between Paul and the people right over in that territory that is happening now.</p>
     
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Acts 24:24-25</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent 
      for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when 
      I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</strong>  You see, he knew there was truth.  And when he learned that he had to live temperate and the judgment was coming, and he had to 
      live righteously, he says, no, go away.  Come back and I will call you another day.  Amen. Now remember, we are trying to learn what kind of a man Daniel was and why he was used before 
      kings and so forth because that is what we are going to be used for in this end time.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 12</p>  
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:7-11</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the 
      captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days,</strong>  Now this is 
      because they were jealous, remember up here in verse 4, because the king wanted to give Daniel this high position. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty 
      days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes 
      and Persians, which altereth not.</strong>  Now you see, they looked every way possible to find some fault in him and couldn’t find it.  So they said, we know that we can’t find it so we 
      will have to trap him some way according to the laws of his God against our laws that we have set up.</p> 
   

    <p class="w3-justify">And that is exactly what they will do to us.  We have to be strong enough to stand up there and say, I won’t take it.  (The mark of the beast.)  Amen.  And the Bible 
      plainly states that many will be slain because they refuse to take the mark.  And many will be protected supernaturally by God, like Daniel.  I think this is such a beautiful picture for 
      what the Bible speaks of the last days that we are coming into here, that ties in here. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</strong>  But you see he loved Daniel.  
      He really tried to save Daniel. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled 
      upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</strong>  See, he walked steady before his God and did not change his worship, although 
      he knew he faced death.  It didn’t change him one bit.  He went right on doing just like he had always done.  That was the commandment under the law that he was to face Jerusalem and pray 
      three times a day and that is exactly (what he did) – he went right on.  He paid no regard to man whatsoever, even the laws of the king, knowing whether he was killed or whether not, he 
      was not going to bend.  I tell you, you have to be some kind of character.  You have to really know who your God is to always do such a thing as that, to not bend under the face of any 
      circumstance. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</strong> </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 13</p>  
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:12-17</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not 
      signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, 
      The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity 
      of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with 
      himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him:</strong>  The king was trapped into a decree, to sign it against his will. <strong class="w3-text-cyan"> and he laboured till the going down of the sun to 
      deliver him. Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king 
      establisheth may be changed.</strong>  And do you know that I heard that several times, through Khomehni and through different ones over there, of the Moslems – that they go back into 
      their old laws and that it is written thus and so, and Khomehni says it cannot be changed.  He does not fear God or man. He is standing on just exactly what he says.  Do you remember 
      that the word came through the prophecy that this man – through someone here, well, it doesn’t matter who; it was the word of God for sure.  Before they had first started to negotiate 
      with Khomehni – and it was that no one could have any influence on him.  He wasn’t afraid of people or nobody.  You couldn’t negotiate with him.  You couldn’t do anything.  You couldn’t 
      sway him.  Now that is in one of the prophecies, because I read it the other day in the prophecies at home, that had come.  And sure enough it is true.  There is no way – they have tried 
      every way to negotiate with him and they still have the hostages over there.  And that is this Moslem faith. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the 
      den of lions. Now</strong>  This is an amazing statement, the rest of this verse. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver 
      thee.</strong>   Do you see the faith this old king had, because he had watched Daniel come through before.  And the old king, he realized that the God was real.  And he loved Daniel and 
      he encourages him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</strong>  They had thrown him into the lion’s den. </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 14</p>  
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:19-23</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. And 
      when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest 
      continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</strong>  He didn’t say the God whom thou served.He said the God in whom thou servest continually, all the time, without stopping.  
      Amen. Steady. He walked. He walked in favor with God. Isn’t that a beautiful thing? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath 
      shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me;</strong> e was able to say that himself.  I have done no man no hurt.  I am innocent, 
      Daniel said.  I am innocent before God. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</strong>  What a beautiful testimony. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then was the king exceeding glad for him, 
      and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</strong> Isn’t 
      it beautiful that God put that in there, in his book?  The reason he was spared, because Daniel believed in his God.  Isn’t that precious?  That is what it is all about, isn’t it?  He says, 
      without faith it is impossible to please God. </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:24-28</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast 
      them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. 
      Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. I make a decree, </strong> Now look, here is this king, what a 
      beautiful man he changed into be from the testimony of one man – Daniel – that God had used, and because he dared to stand up and be frank and open when his life was at stake, that he 
      dared to stand up and say and tell you right straight, right down the line.  Amen.  We can hardly do that when we know we have to speak truth to set somebody free, when our life isn’t 
      at stake. We must speak truth.  When God gives us something, we must be faithful to deliver that one.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and 
      fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. He 
      delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</strong>  Amen.</p> 

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 15</p> 

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel's record stands as an example of God’s power and faithfulness to all mankind who will live godly and obedient, forsaking all self will and so forth.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Remember what I said God had spoken to me, that in these last days – remember some time ago – God said, I must have some Daniels?  Do you remember that?  I've said it 
      so many times, who would dare to trust and believe him?  God spoke that to me and it just sends my flesh creeping every time I say it, because it is so true.  God must – and he spoke it 
      so plain to me – he said, I must have some Daniels in these last days.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Just through this today, I think we have a little better understanding of who Daniel was and what he was and what kind of faith he had in God.  Amen.  And it makes me 
      have – just because Daniel lived and his testimony still lives – it makes me just have a little more courage to see how God delivered him out of everything, everything.  When he would 
      stand faithful, God never failed Daniel one time.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel 7 is the beginning of the kingdom of our day.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 7:21-22</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; Until the 
      Ancient of days came,</strong>  Until Christ comes back in the fullness of his Spirit in the sons of God.  That is what he is saying. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and judgment was given to the saints of the 
      most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</strong>  </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 7:27</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be 
      given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions</strong> All dominions.  All dominions.  All domains.  All nations. 
      <strong class="w3-text-cyan">shall serve and obey him.</strong>  </p> 

   <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 16</p> 

    <p class="w3-justify">Under the rulership and reigning of the Sons of God who are filled with the power of God.What a hope.  Amen.  Isn’t that better than that thing that you used to hear 
      about, flying away, that you can’t even find any place?  They have never told us where it was or anything about it.  Now this completely takes all of that out of there.  It is not 
      possible.  He says we are going to rule and reign over all nations, over all dominions over all kingdoms in the earth.  And the Bible has always been the same.  It is not changed.  It is 
      just that man didn’t have an understanding of it. Don’t let us forget, amen, what our call is, that he must have many Daniels in these last days.  He will send us before kings and before 
      governors and before rulers of the nations and it says that they will come to us for wisdom and understanding of their problems. </p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel was a man just like the rest of us.  He knew that if he obeyed God and did the will of God then God would have to keep his laws.  God would not fail.  I think 
      we sell ourselves short a lot of times.  Most generally, don’t we?  Because we have our hopes to the extent that we think we can’t make a mistake.  We are full of mistakes because we are 
      flesh.  But God will work on that.  God is working on that.  He is the one that perfects us.  Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Our job is to walk with him, be obedient to the things that we know.  Just to be obedient to all of the way that we know to walk.  It is up to God then to bring us in.  Amen. 
      Isn’t he a beautiful God?</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify"> I just feel so good to know that God is no respecter of persons, and if he can make a Daniel back then, and he said he has to have more Daniels, so we know he is 
      going to fix us up.  Amen. Do you want to be a Daniel?  Jackie, do you want to be a Daniel?  Okay.  Amen.</p>
