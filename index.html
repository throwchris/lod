    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red"></strong> </span></p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">This is a study.  Now usually all we have studied in Daniel has been prophecies about the nations and so on and so forth.  But God 
      impressed me to study the life of Daniel.  Why did God use him to reveal past and future secrets of Iran, the new kingdom age to the end?  Because all of his 
      dealings were in the land of Persia, which is Iran.  Do you hear what I am saying?  And this is where all the problem is, where it will be, and where the 
      beginning of all this trouble will start, according to the scriptures.  So we want to find out, and how it affects every one of us – and every living human 
      being will be affected by this, by this nation especially.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Why did God choose Daniel for that special work to reveal something from way back?  I don’t know how far back the history goes of Persia, 
      but it goes a long way back.  I know that I was looking up some things this morning and I believe it was 452 years before Christ that King Darius was overcome 
      by Alexander the Great.  And I am sure that it was a nation long before that in Persia.  I imagine it started clear back with Cain and Abel, or Jacob and Esau, 
      or this warring factor between the true Christian, the true spirit of God and the false spirit that they say is God.  Just like Isaac and Ishmael being the warring 
      factor between the two nations when his mother cried out because she was kicked out – the mother of Ishmael – and the angel appeared to her and strengthened her and 
      gave her water to drink, and God said I will make of Ishmael a nation also.</p>   
    
      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>
       

    <p class="w3-justify">So this war is still going on.  But we want to see why, and how Daniel’s life affects us, and the things that were spoken by God through him.  
      It says that he feared God above all men, even kings.  He knew no man or beast, even the lions, could take his life.  I haven’t seen anyone like that in our group, 
      have you?  Right?  Just facing it, honest.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">That will walk up with no fear, not because they think they are tough, but because they know that God is who he says he is.  And we have to get 
      to that place to where we know that God is really who he is.  And when he said he will not allow a hair of our heads to be harmed.  And look at the three Hebrew children 
      walk right into the fire and it says their hair wasn’t even singed when they were cast into the furnace.  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego – it says their hair wasn’t even 
      singed.  Their clothing didn’t smell of smoke.  We talk about miracles now.  Look what happened back then in the beginning long, long, long before our time.  Amen.  I think 
      we have a little ways to go, don’t you?</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">We can’t blow our horns too much.  Amen.  I praise God for what he has done in us.  Look at the book of Acts.  And he wants to prepare a people now 
      that will really – that he will really be able to put his Spirit in, that he can trust us up against any circumstance in the earth, that he can trust us knowing that we will 
      believe him and have faith in him, that our God can do all things.  Everything impossible, that man looks upon as impossible, God can do.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And he also says without him, man can do nothing.  We can’t even cause our hair to grow, did you know that?  Without the power of God, without the life of 
      God, we can’t even cause a fingernail to grow in our own body?  We are pretty helpless, aren’t we?  The water that we drink out of the ground comes from God.  The oil that we are 
      pumping up, God placed there.  The wood that we burn, God’s life caused the tree to grow.  We need to know who God is.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I don’t want to get too far on this, because I didn’t plan any of this, but it is just God revealing himself to us.  And he wants to reveal himself in such a 
      way that every step we take, we know we are taking because God is in us.  Amen.  And we won’t be a people of mistakes, but we will be a people of absolute surety that we are doing 
      the will of God in all things, that everything we do, we will know that God is with us and directing us – in everything.  And if we don’t come into that place, well we can’t make 
      it, not in the days that are ahead of us.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And he knew God’s voice.  He really knew it.  And he knew that if he served God with all of his heart that God would never fail him in one thing, not in one thing.  
      This is why he could do the things that we are going to read about, without any fear.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">You don’t hear of him going out and doing any great things.  He just walked in the earth, did the job that God told him to do, never went out and tried to do any 
      great thing, but everything came to him.  Every circumstance that ever happened in his life, he was just going on and doing his thing and he was confronted with certain things that he 
      had to do, that God demanded of him.  He didn’t ask to be thrown in the lion’s den.  He didn’t ask to interpret dreams.  He didn’t ask that.  God just put that in him because he followed 
      God and that was God’s calling on his life.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">All of these things that happened in his life – you say, well, I can’t live for God because of this or because of my husband or because of my wife or because of the 
      circumstance or because of this or that.  Now listen, that is a lot of malarkey, isn't it?  Because Daniel had been captured from the Israelites and was put right in the midst of all 
      the wicked witchcraft, idolatry, soothsayers, astrologers, star gazers and so forth.  That is where he lived, right among everything in the occult, much stronger than it is today, right 
      among all the superstition, the ungodly, right among the wicked king that God just put his fingers on every once in awhile because of their wickedness.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So we have no excuse for not going on in God and getting the fullness of God.  We have no excuse, because it doesn’t matter where we are from or where we live or what 
      our circumstances are.  If you want God, God will meet you.  It is the question of wanting God, whether we really want him or not.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">In Daniel 1, we are going to read some, quite a bit in fact.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:3-4</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the 
      children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</strong>  Now, if I had gone back a little bit, you would see that they had been captured and they had taken special ones and 
      brought them into the king's quarters.  And so he’s saying to his eunuch that he should bring certain ones from the children of Israel that have been captured, of the king’s seed, and of 
      the princes. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them 
      to stand in the king's palace,</strong>  Now they didn’t just choose everybody to stand in the king’s palace. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the 
      Chaldeans.</strong> Now if you follow the story of the Chaldeans, you know what kind of people (they are).</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:6</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</strong> </p>  
  
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:8-9</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's 
      meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Now God had brought Daniel</strong>  Now you see. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">into 
      favour and tender love with the prince</strong> Or the leader <strong class="w3-text-cyan">of the eunuchs.</strong>  Now God gives you favor.  You see, somebody just doesn’t happen to like you.  God is the one 
      who gives you favor with people and he gave Daniel favor.  So if you think that people like you just because you happen to be super, no, that's not the case.  God gives us favor with man 
      that we might be a testimony of him – not because we are something special, amen, but because he wants us for some special purpose to do some special thing.  And this is where pride will 
      come in if you are not careful, if suddenly people start to like you and you say, hmm, I must be somebody.  No, you are nobody, just God is giving you a little favor with someone that you 
      might be a testimony to that one or something.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>  
    
    <p class="w3-justify">In verses 18 through 21, because we want to learn about Daniel.  We are not going to study prophecy today or concerning the nations.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:18-21</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of 
      the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they 
      before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them</strong> Listen to this. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">ten times better than all the magicians and 
      astrologers that were in all his realm.</strong> Now, the others were using witchcraft.  And these boys just knew their God.  You see, there are just certain natural tendencies that come 
      when we are born again.  You will find yourself turning from a dummy into being a brain, smart in the spirit of God, if you follow God.  It just naturally happens.  I have watched it 
      through my entire life.  Suddenly even their appearance starts to change as they walk with God in obedience.  They become more intelligent.  You see, because he gives us – that is a 
      promise of God – a sound mind.  Amen.</p>
    

    <p class="w3-justify">So we just naturally take on some attributes of the Father because we are his children now.  And if we will allow the Spirit to work with us we will actually become 
      brains in the Spirit as God speaks through us.  The mysteries of God will start coming out and you will just wonder where they are coming from, because you know that you didn’t know that 
      much.  You are not that smart.  Amen.  Haven’t you found that happen to you?  Amen.  Don’t be so pious.  I know it is the truth.  Amen.  Things that you know you don’t know but you speak 
      it out.  Because he doesn’t go through the mind, he comes through here, through the Spirit.  Amen.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I am not just teaching this to just to be teaching.  I hope you understand that.  But that we might learn.  I feel there is a secret in here somewhere that we 
      might learn what God expects of us that we might come into that place of fellowship and that place of favor with God to where we can be used.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:10-11</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, </strong> This is when they had sent to find 
      out – I don’t want to cover all of these dreams and everything, but all of his men could not interpret the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had had so <strong class="w3-text-cyan">The Chaldeans answered before the 
      king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: </strong> Or this dream that he had. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked 
      such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</strong>  See, all they knew was by witchcraft and so they couldn’t answer what was in his heart, the dream that God had given 
      him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And it is a rare thing</strong>  They are telling him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling 
      is not with flesh.</strong> See how ignorant they were of the Spirit of God?  Whose dwelling is not with flesh.  </p>
