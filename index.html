    <p class="w3-justify">This is a study.  Now usually all we have studied in Daniel has been prophecies about the nations and so on and so forth.  But God 
      impressed me to study the life of Daniel.  Why did God use him to reveal past and future secrets of Iran, the new kingdom age to the end?  Because all of his 
      dealings were in the land of Persia, which is Iran.  Do you hear what I am saying?  And this is where all the problem is, where it will be, and where the 
      beginning of all this trouble will start, according to the scriptures.  So we want to find out, and how it affects every one of us – and every living human 
      being will be affected by this, by this nation especially.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Why did God choose Daniel for that special work to reveal something from way back?  I don’t know how far back the history goes of Persia, 
      but it goes a long way back.  I know that I was looking up some things this morning and I believe it was 452 years before Christ that King Darius was overcome 
      by Alexander the Great.  And I am sure that it was a nation long before that in Persia.  I imagine it started clear back with Cain and Abel, or Jacob and Esau, 
      or this warring factor between the true Christian, the true spirit of God and the false spirit that they say is God.  Just like Isaac and Ishmael being the warring 
      factor between the two nations when his mother cried out because she was kicked out – the mother of Ishmael – and the angel appeared to her and strengthened her and 
      gave her water to drink, and God said I will make of Ishmael a nation also.</p>   
    
      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>
       

    <p class="w3-justify">So this war is still going on.  But we want to see why, and how Daniel’s life affects us, and the things that were spoken by God through him.  
      It says that he feared God above all men, even kings.  He knew no man or beast, even the lions, could take his life.  I haven’t seen anyone like that in our group, 
      have you?  Right?  Just facing it, honest.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">That will walk up with no fear, not because they think they are tough, but because they know that God is who he says he is.  And we have to get 
      to that place to where we know that God is really who he is.  And when he said he will not allow a hair of our heads to be harmed.  And look at the three Hebrew children 
      walk right into the fire and it says their hair wasn’t even singed when they were cast into the furnace.  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego – it says their hair wasn’t even 
      singed.  Their clothing didn’t smell of smoke.  We talk about miracles now.  Look what happened back then in the beginning long, long, long before our time.  Amen.  I think 
      we have a little ways to go, don’t you?</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">We can’t blow our horns too much.  Amen.  I praise God for what he has done in us.  Look at the book of Acts.  And he wants to prepare a people now 
      that will really – that he will really be able to put his Spirit in, that he can trust us up against any circumstance in the earth, that he can trust us knowing that we will 
      believe him and have faith in him, that our God can do all things.  Everything impossible, that man looks upon as impossible, God can do.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And he also says without him, man can do nothing.  We can’t even cause our hair to grow, did you know that?  Without the power of God, without the life of 
      God, we can’t even cause a fingernail to grow in our own body?  We are pretty helpless, aren’t we?  The water that we drink out of the ground comes from God.  The oil that we are 
      pumping up, God placed there.  The wood that we burn, God’s life caused the tree to grow.  We need to know who God is.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I don’t want to get too far on this, because I didn’t plan any of this, but it is just God revealing himself to us.  And he wants to reveal himself in such a 
      way that every step we take, we know we are taking because God is in us.  Amen.  And we won’t be a people of mistakes, but we will be a people of absolute surety that we are doing 
      the will of God in all things, that everything we do, we will know that God is with us and directing us – in everything.  And if we don’t come into that place, well we can’t make 
      it, not in the days that are ahead of us.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">And he knew God’s voice.  He really knew it.  And he knew that if he served God with all of his heart that God would never fail him in one thing, not in one thing.  
      This is why he could do the things that we are going to read about, without any fear.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">You don’t hear of him going out and doing any great things.  He just walked in the earth, did the job that God told him to do, never went out and tried to do any 
      great thing, but everything came to him.  Every circumstance that ever happened in his life, he was just going on and doing his thing and he was confronted with certain things that he 
      had to do, that God demanded of him.  He didn’t ask to be thrown in the lion’s den.  He didn’t ask to interpret dreams.  He didn’t ask that.  God just put that in him because he followed 
      God and that was God’s calling on his life.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">All of these things that happened in his life – you say, well, I can’t live for God because of this or because of my husband or because of my wife or because of the 
      circumstance or because of this or that.  Now listen, that is a lot of malarkey, isn't it?  Because Daniel had been captured from the Israelites and was put right in the midst of all 
      the wicked witchcraft, idolatry, soothsayers, astrologers, star gazers and so forth.  That is where he lived, right among everything in the occult, much stronger than it is today, right 
      among all the superstition, the ungodly, right among the wicked king that God just put his fingers on every once in awhile because of their wickedness.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So we have no excuse for not going on in God and getting the fullness of God.  We have no excuse, because it doesn’t matter where we are from or where we live or what 
      our circumstances are.  If you want God, God will meet you.  It is the question of wanting God, whether we really want him or not.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">In Daniel 1, we are going to read some, quite a bit in fact.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:3-4</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the 
      children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</strong>  Now, if I had gone back a little bit, you would see that they had been captured and they had taken special ones and 
      brought them into the king's quarters.  And so he’s saying to his eunuch that he should bring certain ones from the children of Israel that have been captured, of the king’s seed, and of 
      the princes. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them 
      to stand in the king's palace,</strong>  Now they didn’t just choose everybody to stand in the king’s palace. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the 
      Chaldeans.</strong> Now if you follow the story of the Chaldeans, you know what kind of people (they are).</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:6</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</strong> </p>  
  
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:8-9</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's 
      meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Now God had brought Daniel</strong>  Now you see. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">into 
      favour and tender love with the prince</strong> Or the leader <strong class="w3-text-cyan">of the eunuchs.</strong>  Now God gives you favor.  You see, somebody just doesn’t happen to like you.  God is the one 
      who gives you favor with people and he gave Daniel favor.  So if you think that people like you just because you happen to be super, no, that's not the case.  God gives us favor with man 
      that we might be a testimony of him – not because we are something special, amen, but because he wants us for some special purpose to do some special thing.  And this is where pride will 
      come in if you are not careful, if suddenly people start to like you and you say, hmm, I must be somebody.  No, you are nobody, just God is giving you a little favor with someone that you 
      might be a testimony to that one or something.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>  
    
    <p class="w3-justify">In verses 18 through 21, because we want to learn about Daniel.  We are not going to study prophecy today or concerning the nations.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 1:18-21</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of 
      the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they 
      before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them</strong> Listen to this. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">ten times better than all the magicians and 
      astrologers that were in all his realm.</strong> Now, the others were using witchcraft.  And these boys just knew their God.  You see, there are just certain natural tendencies that come 
      when we are born again.  You will find yourself turning from a dummy into being a brain, smart in the spirit of God, if you follow God.  It just naturally happens.  I have watched it 
      through my entire life.  Suddenly even their appearance starts to change as they walk with God in obedience.  They become more intelligent.  You see, because he gives us – that is a 
      promise of God – a sound mind.  Amen.</p>
    

    <p class="w3-justify">So we just naturally take on some attributes of the Father because we are his children now.  And if we will allow the Spirit to work with us we will actually become 
      brains in the Spirit as God speaks through us.  The mysteries of God will start coming out and you will just wonder where they are coming from, because you know that you didn’t know that 
      much.  You are not that smart.  Amen.  Haven’t you found that happen to you?  Amen.  Don’t be so pious.  I know it is the truth.  Amen.  Things that you know you don’t know but you speak 
      it out.  Because he doesn’t go through the mind, he comes through here, through the Spirit.  Amen.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Now I am not just teaching this to just to be teaching.  I hope you understand that.  But that we might learn.  I feel there is a secret in here somewhere that we 
      might learn what God expects of us that we might come into that place of fellowship and that place of favor with God to where we can be used.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:10-11</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, </strong> This is when they had sent to find 
      out – I don’t want to cover all of these dreams and everything, but all of his men could not interpret the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had had so <strong class="w3-text-cyan">The Chaldeans answered before the 
      king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: </strong> Or this dream that he had. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked 
      such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</strong>  See, all they knew was by witchcraft and so they couldn’t answer what was in his heart, the dream that God had given 
      him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And it is a rare thing</strong>  They are telling him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling 
      is not with flesh.</strong> See how ignorant they were of the Spirit of God?  Whose dwelling is not with flesh.  </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 4</p>

      to be slain.</strong> Because Daniel was the head over the magicians and over all of them, so they were going to kill Daniel and all of them too. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then Daniel answered with counsel 
      and wisdom</strong>  There is that God living in there, see, that Spirit of God.  He answered with counsel and wisdom. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth 
      to slay the wise men of Babylon:</strong>  He had an order to kill them all. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then 
      Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king</strong>  Pretty bold wasn’t he, to go right to the king?</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:18-28</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and

        answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</strong>  Their lives were spared.  You see, I am sure that some of you have found answers 
        in a dream.  He calls it a night vision.  I am sure that you had a night vision, and God directed him here.  Now these things come from God and I am sure many of us have had things 
        answered and direction given by dreams in the night.  And that is God in us. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom 
        unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</strong>  Now you can’t know understanding unless you have God in your heart.  That comes after you have accepted Jesus 
        Christ.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</strong>  Our God. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">I thank thee, and praise thee, 
        O thou God of my fathers,</strong>  Do you see why Daniel was favored? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast 
        now made known unto us the king's matter. Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy 
        not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</strong> </p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">And I don’t believe that Daniel was just crying out for himself.  I don’t think God could have used him.  I think he was crying out for all of his friends and for 
      those that were in error and didn’t know truth and didn’t know the true God.  I don’t think he just did it to save his life.  I believe Daniel was a greater man than that.  There was a 
      great love in him that caused him to do that. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that 
      will make known unto the king the interpretation.</strong> Do you know some of the prophecies and some of the word of God that says when we are brought before kings in the last days and 
      before governors and rulers, that we should not even think about what we are going to speak but the Spirit will speak through us?  See, it is the same thing all over again that is 
      coming.  This is why we have to know our God and know the Spirit if we are ever going to accomplish for Christ what he has told us that we can accomplish. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">The king answered and 
      said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</strong>  Can’t you imagine that old king was 
      really upset?  After ordering that all of these should be slain and here comes a man that says I can do it.  You know?  But listen to what Daniel tells him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Daniel answered in the 
      presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</strong>  </p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">He wasn’t afraid to tell that king there was a God in heaven.  He was afraid of nothing, what man could do to him.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-cyan">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions 
      of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</strong>  And we know that he goes and explains the whole thing about the image of gold and of brass and of iron and of clay and the toes and the 
      kingdoms divided which is, I believe, where we are now.  I do.  I feel that this is where we are right now as far – I don’t want to get on to Bible prophecy, but I feel by the Spirit 
      that we are where the iron and the clay cannot mix.  There is a divided country over there, see.  And the world is divided in their opinion about many things.  And we are right in that 
      place where nothing is stable.  Iron and clay cannot mix.  And that is what the Bible says. </p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Let me just read this much.  I hadn’t planned on it, but I see it right here.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 2:41-49</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the 
      kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, 
      and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</strong>  And we know the condition over there right now, don’t we?  Remember this was that country, and he 
      just said over here it would be in the latter days.  So we can claim it for this now. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the 
      seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</strong> Did you ever see such a mixing of people?  We had Americans and Germans and Frenchmen 
      and everybody from all of the different countries in the world almost, over there trying to get this thing straightened out, but they could not mix.  It wouldn’t stand.  I don’t think 
      this has ever happened in history before, where people from all nations, all these reporters and preachers and you name it, they have been over there trying to straighten this 
      thing out. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom,</strong> See, God is going to take over pretty soon.  I hope we are all ready, don’t you?  
      Amen.  We are part of that. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and

      is a terrible danger if God calls us into a special calling, that we think that we are somebody and because we are somebody, God has chosen us for some calling or saved us for something.

      time thing will be between the spirit of Satan and the Spirit that is in the Sons, you see.  If we can understand that men are not coming against us because they dislike us.  They come 
      against us because it is the spirit of Satan that is out to destroy the Sons of God because if they could destroy the Sons of God, then Satan will go on with what he is doing now.  So 
      the war, the Scripture says, it is not against flesh and blood.  If we can remember that, that is the Scripture.  It says it is not against flesh and blood, but it is against 
      principalities and powers and wickedness in high places, the spirits.  You see, this flesh is just a vessel for spirits, either the Spirit of God or the spirit of wickedness.  This flesh 
      is nothing. Do you see what I am trying to say?  Amen. </p>

      over there in the world since the beginning, against Isaac and Ishmael.  The same spirit against the true Spirit of God and against the spirit of Satan that is determined.  The war is 
      between Satan and God.  And Satan has never given up the hope that he is someday going to overthrow God’s kingdom.  That is what it is all about.  If you know the scriptures, you will 
      know what I am saying.  That is what the war is.  That is what it has always been, and that is what it will always be.  It is evil trying to overcome good, and it is doing a pretty good

      three times a day and that is exactly (what he did) – he went right on.  He paid no regard to man whatsoever, even the laws of the king, knowing whether he was killed or whether not, he 
      was not going to bend.  I tell you, you have to be some kind of character.  You have to really know who your God is to always do such a thing as that, to not bend under the face of any

      of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with 
      himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him:</strong>  The king was trapped into a decree, to sign it against his will. <strong class="w3-text-cyan"> and he laboured till the going down of the sun to 
      deliver him. Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king 
      establisheth may be changed.</strong>  And do you know that I heard that several times, through Khomehni and through different ones over there, of the Moslems – that they go back into 
      their old laws and that it is written thus and so, and Khomehni says it cannot be changed.  He does not fear God or man. He is standing on just exactly what he says.  Do you remember 
      that the word came through the prophecy that this man – through someone here, well, it doesn’t matter who; it was the word of God for sure.  Before they had first started to negotiate 
      with Khomehni – and it was that no one could have any influence on him.  He wasn’t afraid of people or nobody.  You couldn’t negotiate with him.  You couldn’t do anything.  You couldn’t 
      sway him.  Now that is in one of the prophecies, because I read it the other day in the prophecies at home, that had come.  And sure enough it is true.  There is no way – they have tried 
      every way to negotiate with him and they still have the hostages over there.  And that is this Moslem faith. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the 
      den of lions. Now</strong>  This is an amazing statement, the rest of this verse. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver 
      thee.</strong>   Do you see the faith this old king had, because he had watched Daniel come through before.  And the old king, he realized that the God was real.  And he loved Daniel and 
      he encourages him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</strong>  They had thrown him into the lion’s den. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:19-23</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. And 
      when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest 
      continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</strong>  He didn’t say the God whom thou served.He said the God in whom thou servest continually, all the time, without stopping.  
      Amen. Steady. He walked. He walked in favor with God. Isn’t that a beautiful thing? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath 
      shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me;</strong> e was able to say that himself.  I have done no man no hurt.  I am innocent, 
      Daniel said.  I am innocent before God. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</strong>  What a beautiful testimony. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then was the king exceeding glad for him, 
      and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</strong> Isn’t 
      it beautiful that God put that in there, in his book?  The reason he was spared, because Daniel believed in his God.  Isn’t that precious?  That is what it is all about, isn’t it?  He says, 
      without faith it is impossible to please God. </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:24-28</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast 
      them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. 
      Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. I make a decree, </strong> Now look, here is this king, what a 
      beautiful man he changed into be from the testimony of one man – Daniel – that God had used, and because he dared to stand up and be frank and open when his life was at stake, that he 
      dared to stand up and say and tell you right straight, right down the line.  Amen.  We can hardly do that when we know we have to speak truth to set somebody free, when our life isn’t 
      at stake. We must speak truth.  When God gives us something, we must be faithful to deliver that one.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and 
      fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. He 
      delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</strong>  Amen.</p> 

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 16</p> 

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel's record stands as an example of God’s power and faithfulness to all mankind who will live godly and obedient, forsaking all self will and so forth.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Remember what I said God had spoken to me, that in these last days – remember some time ago – God said, I must have some Daniels?  Do you remember that?  I've said it 
      so many times, who would dare to trust and believe him?  God spoke that to me and it just sends my flesh creeping every time I say it, because it is so true.  God must – and he spoke it 
      so plain to me – he said, I must have some Daniels in these last days.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Just through this today, I think we have a little better understanding of who Daniel was and what he was and what kind of faith he had in God.  Amen.  And it makes me 
      have – just because Daniel lived and his testimony still lives – it makes me just have a little more courage to see how God delivered him out of everything, everything.  When he would 
      stand faithful, God never failed Daniel one time.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel 7 is the beginning of the kingdom of our day.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 7:21-22</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; Until the 
      Ancient of days came,</strong>  Until Christ comes back in the fullness of his Spirit in the sons of God.  That is what he is saying. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and judgment was given to the saints of the 
      most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</strong>  </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 7:27</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be 
      given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions</strong> All dominions.  All dominions.  All domains.  All nations. 
      <strong class="w3-text-cyan">shall serve and obey him.</strong>  </p>  
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Under the rulership and reigning of the Sons of God who are filled with the power of God.What a hope.  Amen.  Isn’t that better than that thing that you used to hear 
      about, flying away, that you can’t even find any place?  They have never told us where it was or anything about it.  Now this completely takes all of that out of there.  It is not 
      possible.  He says we are going to rule and reign over all nations, over all dominions over all kingdoms in the earth.  And the Bible has always been the same.  It is not changed.  It is 
      just that man didn’t have an understanding of it. Don’t let us forget, amen, what our call is, that he must have many Daniels in these last days.  He will send us before kings and before 
      governors and before rulers of the nations and it says that they will come to us for wisdom and understanding of their problems. </p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Daniel was a man just like the rest of us.  He knew that if he obeyed God and did the will of God then God would have to keep his laws.  God would not fail.  I think 
      we sell ourselves short a lot of times.  Most generally, don’t we?  Because we have our hopes to the extent that we think we can’t make a mistake.  We are full of mistakes because we are 
      flesh.  But God will work on that.  God is working on that.  He is the one that perfects us.  Amen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Our job is to walk with him, be obedient to the things that we know.  Just to be obedient to all of the way that we know to walk.  It is up to God then to bring us in.  Amen. 
      Isn’t he a beautiful God?</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify"> I just feel so good to know that God is no respecter of persons, and if he can make a Daniel back then, and he said he has to have more Daniels, so we know he is 
      going to fix us up.  Amen. Do you want to be a Daniel?  Jackie, do you want to be a Daniel?  Okay.  Amen.</p>
