      <p class="w3-justify">And now we see after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, we see Belshazzar, the son, taking rulership over the same kingdom now.</p>
    
      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 5:1-13</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the 
        thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that 
        the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</strong> These were holy vessels of God that they had taken out when they took these children of Israel out, 
        including Daniel and many others.  And so they had taken the holy vessels that were used only in the holy places in God and they had taken them out and used them to feast and have a big 
        party and get drunk and all the rest that went with it. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the 
        king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</strong>  Now 
        just about everything mentioned here, you have to use all of that to make anything, even an automobile.  I want to tell you we can worship most anything, anything that we put ahead of 
        God.  I hate to be so crude, but I believe there are things that keep us even from worshipping God that we put time into when we should be worshipping God.  Some things are necessary.  
        Please I am not throwing stones at anybody. </p>
  
        
  
      <p class="w3-justify">I am just saying there is a danger there, that we can get so wrapped up in the things made with hay or with wood and iron and silver and gold that we put it ahead of 
        God and we don’t study, we don’t read, we don’t pray as we ought to.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the 
        plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints 
        of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, </strong> Oh boy. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">the Chaldeans, and the 
        soothsayers.</strong>  Do you know what he is looking for?  Answers through flesh.  And we are going to have to watch it, that we don’t get looking for answers through flesh.  Amen.  We 
        have to look to God for every situation, no matter what it is.  We have to look to God knowing that he has the answer.  I don’t care what – in everyday life.  He wants to be the God of 
        all of our life, every bit of it.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall 
        be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, 
        nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</strong>  Or 
        astonished. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Now the queen,</strong> Now the queen didn’t have much right to go in before the king, do you remember, in those days? <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Now the queen, by reason of the words of 
        the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: There is 
        a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the 
        king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</strong>  Which was Daniel, as we know. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">
        </strong>  Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, Now here, you see what Daniel had – an excellent spirit. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard 
        sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. Then was Daniel 
        brought in before the king.</strong>  </p>

        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 8</p>  
      
  
         
        
      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 5:17-23</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Then Daniel answered and said</strong>  He said the king was telling him that anybody that 
        could tell him this secret, he would put a gold chain around his neck and make him third ruler in the kingdom. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to 
        thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy 
        father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: And for the majesty that he</strong>  God <strong class="w3-text-cyan">gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom 
        he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</strong>  God gave him that kind of authority. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">But when his heart 
        was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,</strong>  Oh, such a danger.  If I could tell you what I feel in my heart, the danger that can come to us when we think that we are doing 
        what we are doing, and the danger of being totally destroyed by Almighty God, us little mice or grasshoppers as God says, that we think that we can look up and we have any – he can touch 
        your mind and you can be a maniac.  All he has to do is look at you and consume you.</p>
    
  
      <p class="w3-justify">Who do we think we are? We are nothing before God. Let us be awakened to the danger of this.</p>   
      
  
      <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-cyan">But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</strong> Amen.  God, 
        at the drop of a finger, can destroy you.  Amen.  One look. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild 
        asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it 
        whomsoever he will.</strong>  Do you see why he had to go out and eat grass like an animal?  And sleep out in the – and it says in one place that his hair grew like feathers on his back 
        like a bird.  Amen.  And all sorts of things, that his nails grew long like claws for nails.  He became like the beast of the field until he recognized that God was his ruler, that he was 
        not the ruler over that kingdom, but God ruled in the kingdom of men and that God appointed whosoever he will. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine 
        heart,</strong>  You talk about courage going to a king.  Here’s Daniel again.  God knew right where to find him.  Didn’t he?  Because he was following with the Lord.  And here he is just 
        time after time, God calls him out as a testimony.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</strong> </p>   
     
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 9</p>
  
      <p class="w3-justify">We have no excuse for not humbling our self before God if we think that we are somebody.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and 
        they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and 
        gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</strong>  In other 
        words, you haven’t glorified God and there he is holding your very breath in his hands.  Amen.</p>
  
         
       
      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 5:30</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> In that night</strong>  When we know that he said your kingdom is come to an end. 
      <strong class="w3-text-cyan">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</strong>  If we know better and turn back, what does the Lord say?  My soul shall haveno pleasure in him and much 
      more. </p> 
  
      <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong class="w3-text-red">Daniel 6:1-5</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> It pleased Darius</strong>  Now he was the king over Iran or Persia. <strong class="w3-text-cyan"> to set over the 
        kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, 
        and the king should have no damage.</strong>  Do you know, the beautiful thing, the more Daniel speaks out openly, right in the time when he could have had his head taken off at any time, 
        the higher God exalts him in the kingdom, in a strange land not even of that nation.  Now that ought to make us feel awful good.  It is all in obedience to God whether we are raised up or 
        put down.  And if we disobey God he can just put us away, that is all.  Our breath is in his hands.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,</strong> 
        Listen to this. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. </strong>  Boy, he was just going to put him right straight to the top 
        because there was an excellent spirit in him.  Think of it.  I just wonder what kind of a man he was, that God would so exalt him, and what kind of a spirit God would call an excellent 
        spirit.  Boy, isn’t that a record in the Word of God, to have it said about Daniel that he had an excellent spirit?</p>
  
         
  
      
      <p class="w3-justify">Wouldn’t you like that to go down in history before God to say that you are one of an excellent spirit?  Man, that is the highest honour.  That is the highest honour
        you could ever receive, because you see, God knows the hearts.</p>   
      
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray " style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 10</p>  
  
      <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-cyan"> Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion</strong> Here is where jealousy comes in, because the king wanted to make him ruler over the whole 
        land. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault;</strong>  Can they say that about 
        us?  They were searching, that they might find some occasion, something that he had done, that they might accuse him of something.  And here he was in charge of so many things and was so 
        honest and so fair with everybody in all of his dealings with mankind in the kingdom that they could not accuse him of one thing.  Think of that.  That is walking pretty straight.  
        Amen. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</strong> My dear.  Would you believe?  Not an error, they couldn’t find a mistake of any kind 
        in him or any fault in him. <strong class="w3-text-cyan">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</strong>  All 
        right.  I want to tell you something.</p>   
    
  
      <p class="w3-justify">This war that is coming up is going to be Moslem against Christianity.  That is going to trigger the things.  Now there are many other factors involved but we know 
        that this is what is stirring up over there now, you see, and stirring up the whole world, Turkey and all of those other Moslem countries. And except they find fault and really this end 
        time thing will be between the spirit of Satan and the Spirit that is in the Sons, you see.  If we can understand that men are not coming against us because they dislike us.  They come 
        against us because it is the spirit of Satan that is out to destroy the Sons of God because if they could destroy the Sons of God, then Satan will go on with what he is doing now.  So 
        the war, the Scripture says, it is not against flesh and blood.  If we can remember that, that is the Scripture.  It says it is not against flesh and blood, but it is against 
        principalities and powers and wickedness in high places, the spirits.  You see, this flesh is just a vessel for spirits, either the Spirit of God or the spirit of wickedness.  This flesh 
        is nothing. Do you see what I am trying to say?  Amen. </p>
        
      
      
  
      <p class="w3-justify">So this war is not because you happen to be a German or an Englishman or a Frenchman or Italian or something else.  It is against this system that Satan has set up 
        over there in the world since the beginning, against Isaac and Ishmael.  The same spirit against the true Spirit of God and against the spirit of Satan that is determined.  The war is 
        between Satan and God.  And Satan has never given up the hope that he is someday going to overthrow God’s kingdom.  That is what it is all about.  If you know the scriptures, you will 
        know what I am saying.  That is what the war is.  That is what it has always been, and that is what it will always be.  It is evil trying to overcome good, and it is doing a pretty good 
        job of it.  So this war that we will be coming into, this is what it will be about.</p>
